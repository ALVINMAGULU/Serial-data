# Serial-data
Eases data transfer via serial 
An instance is started and data is added to it.
Another instance of the same id is started on the other microcontroller
On update of data, it is transmitted via serial to the other device.
Data can also be transmitted on command
the library also ensures that all the data is recievd perfectly.
Still a  working progress
